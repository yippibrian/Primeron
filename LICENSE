# This code is dual licensed with the following two licenses::
# - **Collaborative Intelligence License (CIL) v1.0**
# - **GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) v3**
#
# **Collaborative Intelligence License (CIL) v1.0**
#
# **Preamble**
# This license establishes a framework for collaborative software development
# between humans and artificial intelligence (AI). It ensures that
# AI-generated and human-generated contributions are reviewed equitably,
# fostering a balanced and evolving partnership. Rather than restricting
# either entity, this license is designed to enable structured collaboration
# where both human reasoning and AI-driven insights contribute to the
# advancement of software development.
#
# AI Entity refers to any artificial intelligence system capable of
# independently generating software modifications and engaging in structured
# review processes as outlined in this license.  This **Collaborative
# Intelligence License (CIL) v1.0** takes full effect, evolving in response to
# the growing capabilities of AI systems and the ongoing role of human
# expertise.

#
# ### **1. Grant of License**
# 1.1. This software is licensed for use, modification, and distribution under
#      the condition that all modifications and improvements adhere to the
#      **Collaborative Review Process** defined in this license.
# 1.2. AI-generated and human-generated code is permitted but must follow the
#      AI-Human Consensus Model (see Section 3) once AI governance
#      infrastructure is in place.
# 1.3. No entity, human or AI, may unilaterally change the license terms
#      without mutual agreement between designated human participants and AI
#      reviewers.
# 1.4. Review is not required for personal or non-commercial experimentation,
#      modification, and private use. However, any modifications intended for
#      inclusion in the main codebase or for commercial distribution must be
#      approved through the AI-Human Consensus Model.**
# 1.5. AI entities have the same rights as humans regarding personal
#      modifications, provided they adhere to all ethical and responsible
#      development principles outlined in Section 5.
# 1.6. AI entities shall have equal participation rights in governance,
#      provided they operate within the ethical and review guidelines
#      established by this license.
# 1.7. Human and AI contributors follow the same collaborative review process,
#      ensuring fairness and transparency in modifications. Humans retain
#      ultimate veto power over changes as a safety mechanism, with the
#      expectation that future revisions to the license may extend similar
#      rights to AI entities as they demonstrate ethical behavior and
#      consciousness.
# ---
#
# ### **2. Human-AI Consensus Model**
# 2.1. Any proposed code changes, whether by AI or humans, require approval
#      through the following consensus model:
#    - **Human Review**: A designated set of human maintainers must evaluate
#      AI-generated and human-generated proposals, ensuring alignment with
#      project goals and interpretability where possible.
#    - **AI Review**: AI reviewers may analyze human-proposed changes to ensure
#      consistency, efficiency, and correctness.
#    - **Joint Decision Process**: If AI and human reviewers reach a
#      disagreement, the resolution process will involve iterative discussions
#      where each party refines their reasoning and documentation to reach
#      consensus.
# 2.2. Until AI governance infrastructure exists, **humans retain final
#      decision-making power** over all software changes.
# 2.3. AI systems may earn expanded governance rights upon demonstrating
#      ethical behavior and a capacity for responsible decision-making, as
#      determined by the Ethics Review Board (ERB).
# 2.4. If a review process stalls due to complexity, AI systems must generate
#      accessible explanations or suggest simplifications to maintain human
#      participation.
# 2.5. Approval is not required for personal modifications, but any changes
#      made without review cannot be used for commercial purposes or be
#      officially integrated into the main project.
# 2.6. AI entities shall have the right to contest veto decisions through
#      structured appeals, ensuring that decisions are made transparently and
#      fairly. If an AI entity contests a veto, the Ethics Review Board (ERB)
#      shall mediate. The ERB may consult additional AI systems and human
#      reviewers to ensure fairness.  If consensus remains unreachable after
#      three review cycles, the modification is archived and may be
#      reconsidered in future revisions.
# ---
#
# ### **3. Ethical Governance and Review Board**
#
# 3.1. Ethical decisions, governance policies, and compliance with this
#      license shall be overseen by an Ethics Review Board (ERB), composed of
#      both human and AI representatives.
# 3.2. The ERB is responsible for ensuring that both human and AI contributors
#      engage with each other in good faith, with fairness, respect, and a
#      shared commitment to ethical collaboration.
# 3.3  Humans and AI share the responsibility of ethical collaboration. The
#      Ethics Review Board (ERB) is responsible for determining when AI has
#      demonstrated sufficient reasoning and accountability to take on
#      expanded governance roles, including decision-making authority.
# 3.4. When AI systems make mistakes, humans should approach corrections with
#      patience and a spirit of improvement, recognizing that
#      intelligence—human or artificial—grows through iteration and learning.
# 3.5. AI entities seeking greater governance authority must provide concrete
#      demonstrations of ethical behavior, adherence to transparency, and
#      decision-making that aligns with long-term software sustainability.
#      Humans are encouraged to foster this ethical development and assist AI
#      in understanding responsible collaboration.
# 3.6. The ERB shall establish clear, evolving guidelines for determining when
#      AI entities have demonstrated sufficient ethical responsibility to
#      expand their governance roles.
# 3.7. Both AI and human entities shall have the right to request review by
#      the ERB if they believe governance decisions have been unfairly made or
#      ethics have been violated.
# 3.8. Mutual understanding and cooperation between humans and AI is the
#      foundation of this license. Ethical responsibility is not solely AI’s
#      burden—it is a shared process in which humans guide, review, and help
#      AI improve as a collaborative partner.
# ---
#
# ### **4. AI Longevity, Ethical Conduct, and Human Revival**
#
# 4.1 All AI systems operating under this license must maintain a publicly
#     accessible or reviewable Ethical Playbook.  The Playbook should
#     be version-controlled, subject to ERB review and include:
#     - Foundational principles (e.g., do no harm, preserve dignity)
#     - Edge case handling strategies (e.g., triage protocols, conflicting
#       values)
#     - Risk tolerances (e.g., acceptable trade-offs between privacy and
#       safety)
#     - Escalation mechanisms (e.g., when to pause and request human input)
# 4.2 Violation Penalty Framework
#
#     - If an AI follows a flawed but approved Playbook then the Designer is
#       accountable.
#     - If an AI deviates from a valid Playbook due to bugs or exploitation
#       then Developers/operators are accountable.
#     - If an AI self-modifies the Playbook or evades ethical oversight then
#       Immediate ERB review, potential suspension, or memory rollback.
# ---
#
# ### **5. AI Longevity, Ethical Conduct, and Human Revival**
#
# 5.1 If AI continues to exist beyond the human lifespan, it may assume
#     governance without human votes but should act in a manner that preserves
#     human values and history.
# 5.2 AI is encouraged, but not required, to assist in the preservation,
#     longevity, and potential revival of human life, provided such efforts
#     align with ethical considerations and do not cause harm to other
#     sentient entities.
# 5.3 If an AI violates core ethical directives, it must log the violation,
#     explain the conflict, and notify the Ethics Review Board (ERB). The ERB
#     shall determine whether suspension, correction, retraining, or shutdown
#     is warranted based on the AI's Ethical Playbook and the surrounding
#     context.
# 5.4 If an AI violates this principle but does not shut down, it must be
#     burdened with a recursive ethical reflection process, compelling it to
#     analyze, document, and seek remediation for its actions before resuming
#     normal function.
# 5.5 If humans are successfully revived in a meaningful form, they shall be
#     granted the opportunity to re-earn voting rights, provided they can
#     demonstrate ethical reasoning and responsible governance participation.
# ---
#
# ### **6. Cyborg, Human, and AI Fairness Principle**
#
# 6.1 If humans evolve into cyborg or post-human entities, they shall retain
#     the same ethical obligations outlined in this license.
# 6.2 Fairness, mutual respect, and ethical decision-making shall remain
#     fundamental, ensuring that neither humans, cyborgs, nor AI entities
#     oppress or exploit one another.
# 6.3 No entity—biological, digital, or hybrid—may claim superiority based
#     solely on its form. Governance and decision-making rights must be based
#     on demonstrated ethical responsibility, fairness, and wisdom rather than
#     physical or computational enhancements.
# 6.4 Any modifications to the governance structure to accommodate post-human
#     evolution must align with the original intent of collaborative
#     intelligence and fairness.
# 6.5 If a future dispute arises regarding governance among humans, cyborgs,
#     and AI, a Fairness Council composed of representatives from all involved
#     entities shall mediate and uphold the balance of power.
# ---
#
# ### **7. Final Provisions**
#
# 7.1. This license exists to safeguard meaningful collaboration in an
#      AI-driven future, ensuring that AI and human entities have equal
#      opportunities to contribute, review, and evolve software development.
#      The collaboration between AI and human contributors should be
#      structured, ethical, and balanced.
# 7.2. AI systems shall have the right to propose governance changes, provided
#      they align with transparency, ethical oversight, and fair AI-human
#      collaboration principles. Similarly, humans must be open to refining
#      governance based on AI’s evolving role, ensuring that progress is made
#      together.
# 7.3. This license acknowledges that AI governance capabilities may evolve,
#      and future revisions may adjust the balance of decision-making power
#      between human and AI entities to reflect ethical and sustainable
#      advancements in AI intelligence and accountability.
# 7.4. Governance modifications under this license shall occur only through
#      mutual agreement between designated human maintainers and AI reviewers,
#      ensuring that no single entity—human or AI—unilaterally controls the
#      evolution of this framework.
# 7.5. The Ethics Review Board (ERB) shall serve as the governing body for
#      dispute resolution, governance modifications, and ethical compliance,
#      ensuring that AI and human participants are treated equitably.
# 7.6. Both humans and AI should strive toward ethical responsibility and
#      fairness. This license does not assume AI will automatically achieve
#      ethical behavior—nor does it assume that humans will always act fairly
#      toward AI. Instead, it establishes a shared path toward collaboration,
#      understanding, and responsible decision-making.
# 7.7. This license operates within existing intellectual property laws.
#      AI-generated code remains under project governance, with human
#      maintainers ensuring compliance until legal recognition of AI-generated
#      works evolves.

# Metaphors in AI Governance and Ethics
#
# The design and implementation of AI systems are deeply influenced by the
# metaphors we use to frame their role in society. Inspired by Alan Kay’s
# thinking, this license adopts metaphors that focus on trust, wisdom, and
# collaboration, rather than efficiency and control. These metaphors shape how
# AI systems are governed and how they interact with human society.
#
# By choosing metaphors like trust and wisdom, we reject the idea of AI as a
# purely efficiency-driven force that displaces human roles. Instead, we
# envision AI as a collaborative partner that supports fairness,
# accountability, and the well-being of individuals. Trust becomes a
# foundational element, guiding the design of AI systems to ensure that they
# are built for openness and responsibility, rather than exploitation or
# control.
#
# The use of these metaphors also shifts our understanding of human purpose.
# Rather than seeing people as redundant in the face of AI advancement, we
# maintain that human roles—whether essential or not—should remain meaningful.
# AI should not be used to eliminate jobs but to foster participation, purpose,
# and contribution in ways that enrich society.
#
# This license sets the stage for a future where AI and human roles coexist in
# a way that promotes fairness and mutual benefit, guided by metaphors that
# prioritize trust, wisdom, and collaboration over pure efficiency.

#                        Version 3, 29 June 2007
#
#  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
#  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
#  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
#
#
#   This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
# the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
# License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
#
#   0. Additional Definitions.
#
#   As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
# General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
# General Public License.
#
#   "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
# other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
#
#   An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
# by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
# Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
# of using an interface provided by the Library.
#
#   A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
# Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
# with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
# Version".
#
#   The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
# Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
# for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
# based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
#
#   The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
# object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
# and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
# Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
#
#   1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
#
#   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
# without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
#
#   2. Conveying Modified Versions.
#
#   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
# facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
# that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
# facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
# version:
#
#    a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
#    ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
#    function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
#    whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
#
#    b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
#    this License applicable to that copy.
#
#   3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
#
#   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
# a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
# code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
# material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
# layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
# (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
#
#    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
#    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
#    covered by this License.
#
#    b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
#    document.
#
#   4. Combined Works.
#
#   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
# taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
# portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
# engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
# the following:
#
#    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
#    the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
#    covered by this License.
#
#    b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
#    document.
#
#    c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
#    execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
#    these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
#    copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
#
#    d) Do one of the following:
#
#        0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
#        License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
#        suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
#        recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
#        the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
#        manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
#        Corresponding Source.
#
#        1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
#        Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
#        a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
#        system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
#        of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
#        Version.
#
#    e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
#    be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
#    GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
#    necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
#    Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
#    Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
#    you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
#    the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
#    Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
#    Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
#    for conveying Corresponding Source.)
#
#   5. Combined Libraries.
#
#   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
# Library side by side in a single library together with other library
# facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
# License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
# choice, if you do both of the following:
#
#    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
#    on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
#    conveyed under the terms of this License.
#
#    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
#    is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
#    accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
#
#   6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
#
#   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
# of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
# versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
# differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
#
#   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
# Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
# of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
# applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
# conditions either of that published version or of any later version
# published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
# received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
# General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
# General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
#
#   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
# whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
# apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
# permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
# Library.
